# How does React work?

-> React is a JavaScript library that follows a component-based architecture and optimizes UI updates using the Virtual DOM.
Instead of directly updating the Real DOM (which is slow), React creates a lightweight Virtual DOM (a JavaScript object).
When a component's state or props change:
1️⃣ React creates a new Virtual DOM and compares it with the previous one using the Diffing Algorithm.
2️⃣ It finds the differences (minimal updates required) and efficiently updates only the necessary parts of the Real DOM—this process is called Reconciliation.
This makes React fast, efficient, and optimized for performance.

# What is JSX?
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows writing HTML-like code inside JS.
It makes React components more readable and easier to write.

 Why JSX?
Makes UI structure declarative and easier to visualize.
Babel transpiles it into React.createElement(), which creates the Virtual DOM representation.
Helps in writing cleaner, more maintainable React code.

✅ JSX Rules & Best Practices
1️⃣ JSX must have a single parent element (wrap multiple elements in <>...</> or <div>...</div>).
2️⃣ Use {} to embed JavaScript expressions inside JSX (<h1>{2 + 2}</h1>).
3️⃣ Use className instead of class, since class is a reserved JS keyword.
4️⃣ All tags must be properly closed (<br />, <img src="" />).
5️⃣ Event handlers use camelCase (onClick instead of onclick).

JSX makes React more intuitive and developer-friendly, but ultimately, it's just JavaScript! 🚀

# What is a Functional Component?
A functional component is a JavaScript function that returns JSX. It is the simplest way to create a component in React.

Key Characteristics
1️⃣ Must start with a capital letter (React treats lowercase as HTML tags).
2️⃣ Returns JSX (or null).
3️⃣ Reusable & composable (can be used inside other components).
4️⃣ No this keyword, unlike class components.
5️⃣ Pure functions – They take props as input and return JSX without side effects.

 Component Composition (Using Components Inside Components)

# Props in React:

1️⃣ Props are properties that are passed to a component.
2️⃣ They are passed from parent to child (one-way data flow).
3️⃣ Parent = The component that contains another component.
4️⃣ Child = The component that receives the props.
5️⃣ Props are passed as attributes inside JSX.
6️⃣ Props are immutable → The child component cannot modify the props it receives.
7️⃣ We can destructure props to make the code cleaner.

📌 useState Hook :

useState() => is a React Hook used to create and manage state in functional components.

Syntax:
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue)

How It Works:
state → Holds the value.
setState() → Function to update the state.
initialValue → Starting value of the state.

✅ Key Points of useState
It re-renders the component whenever state changes.
Never update state directly like count++.
Use setState() to update the value.

📌 Handling Events in React
React uses camelCase for event names (not lowercase like HTML).

Event	        Description
onClick	        Click event
onChange	    Input field changes
onSubmit	    Form submission
onMouseEnter	Hover effect
onMouseLeave	Mouse leaves element

📌 Rendering Lists & Keys
Used to display dynamic lists like arrays.
Use .map() method to loop through the list.
✅ Why Keys?
Keys help React identify which items changed or deleted.

Important Points 🔥
Always use keys inside .map().
Keys must be unique.

✅ Conditional Rendering allows showing different content based on conditions.

1️⃣ if Statements (Outside JSX)
Used outside JSX to return different components.

2️⃣ Ternary Operator ( ? : )
Inline conditional rendering inside JSX.

condition ? <Component1 /> : <Component2 />
👉 Best for rendering two options.

3️⃣ && Short-Circuit Evaluation
Renders content only if the condition is true.

condition && <Component />
👉 Best for showing content based on one condition.

⚡ Key Points:
Use if outside JSX.
Use ? : inside JSX for two options.
Use && for single condition rendering.
Return null if nothing needs to be shown.

# What is useEffect() Hook?
The useEffect hook is used to perform side effects in React components.
Side Effects mean:

API calls
DOM Manipulation
Event Listeners
Timers (setInterval, setTimeout)
Subscriptions

🔑 Syntax

useEffect(() => {
  // Your Side Effect Code
  return () => {
    // Cleanup Code (Optional)
  };
}, [dependencies]);


🎯 How useEffect() Works
Case	                       When will it run?	               Cleanup Run
No Dependency Array	           On every render + re-render 🔄	   ✅ Yes (Every re-render)
Empty Dependency []	           Only on page load 🔥	               ✅ Only on Unmount
With Dependencies [count]	   Runs only when dependencies change   ✅ Before running the effect again

🧠 Why Do We Need return() inside useEffect()?
The return inside useEffect() is used to clean up side effects like:

Clearing Timers
Removing Event Listeners
Cancelling API Requests
Unsubscribing from Streams


🎯 Rule of Thumb 🧠
Task	                Cleanup Needed?
API Call	            ❌ No
Timers	                ✅ Yes
Event Listeners	        ✅ Yes
DOM Manipulation	    ✅ Yes
State Changes	       ❌ No
Local Storage	       ❌ No
Subscriptions(WebSocket, Audio Streams)	✅ Yes

Why Cleanup Is Needed?
If we don't use the return(), the old effect will still run in memory even if the component is removed or re-rendered — This will create Memory Leaks.
